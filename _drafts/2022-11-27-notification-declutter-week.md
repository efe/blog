title: "Notification Declutter Week"
---
We usually get non-required, okay notifications such as email, SMS, or push notifications. They are mostly,

- New registration side effects.
- Newsletters, the product of FOMO.
- Old interests.
- Binance coupons. 

I often silently close or archive them and go on. Because snoozing them is exhausting. On the other hand, The "notification" is a mental load.

As a solution, I pick a week and declutter the notifications. I basically ask myself a question on each new notification, "Does this add value to life and is required?". If not, I unsubscribe without being lazy.

I suggest you do this once if you are also suffocating from notifications.

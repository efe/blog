title: "Getting Rid of Tsundoku"
---

I admire books.

I see them as high-intensity information pills written by a complete expert or a dedicated enthusiast. Firstly, they are fairly cheap or free. Sucking all life experience of an expert just costs you $10. Secondly, They are curated for consuming in a shorter time in contrast to long YouTube videos. This makes it easy to consume. No ads, no bullshit.

Who wouldn't take these pills? I'll take them.

But, I discovered a hidden problem while I was moving house. I have tons of really amazing books and I've just read 10 of them at best. Shocking! I was buying more books than reading them. The diagnosis is [tsundoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku). _Tsundoku is acquiring reading materials but letting them pile up in one's home without reading them._ Yes, It doesn't look cool even it has a cool Japanese name.

New year is a good starting point for gaining habit. So, I've started making a list of books which I'd like to read most in 2020. I would like to dedicate 2020 for reading books. In first iteratition, I had a list with ~65 items. I cut the list to 50 items. However, Is this doable?

I've find articles above. They are thrilling. Honestly, I don't see it as sustainable for life. However, It worths to give a shot for a year. So, I've decided that 2020 will be a reading book year of me.

Also, I've found that all of these hard copy books are waste of woods. So, I decided that not buying a hard copy book if there is an equivalent e-book version.

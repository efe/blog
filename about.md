My name is `Efe Öge`. I am currently **Computer Enginnering Student** @Yıldız Technical University in Istanbul, Turkey. The blog is mostly about **computer science**, **problems** and **software**.

Main philosophy of the blog is `docendo discimus`. It means that ***we learn from teaching***.

You can follow me on **[Github](https://github.com/efe)** or **[Twitter](https://twitter.com/efeoge)**. Also, Don't be shy about sending me an [e-mail](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=016S5i6CBkBjmH6P2b3aewUQ==&c=Si1mVaKRRzDqszorvN3xlw==).

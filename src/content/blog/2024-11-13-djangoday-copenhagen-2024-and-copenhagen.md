I had been in Copenhagen for a long weekend for the [Djangoday Copenhagen 2024](https://2024.djangoday.dk/).

## DjangoDay Copenhagen 2024

The conference was fantastic. I've been living in Eindhoven for nine months now and really miss the PyIstanbul events where I could connect with fellow Python enthusiasts. This was a great opportunity for me to catch up and recharge.

- [Marrying Django and FastAPI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyCMyBv-mCo)

This talk covers how to use fancy async backend Python framework FastAPI in the Django. They use repository pattern to consume Django ORM. An alternative approach to [django-ninja](https://django-ninja.dev/).

- [Django migrations, friend or foe? Optimize them for testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuY48N8d8kw)

This is a very nice wrap-up on how to use Django migrations for beginners, with the additional caveat of optimizing database schema build time in tests. A small takeaway point is that squashing migrations doesn’t actually bring significant improvement. SeedDB might be the ultimate solution, but it is operationally costly. My preference is that the default is good enough.

- [Manage.py as the task runner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XcEsP0yiA3w)

Instead of using a tool like [taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/) or [makefile](https://makefiletutorial.com/), We can just write our own management commands and run them in local or CI/CD. IMO, This is very nice approach.

Last but not least, I also gave a short lightning talk about [Migrating to Django from a legacy database](https://www.youtube.com/live/-msvvauZVvo?si=3i-HyZhdYUysayyL&t=29457).

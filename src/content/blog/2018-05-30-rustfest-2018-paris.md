I'm interesting Rust ðŸ¦€ as second programming language in addition to Python. I'd like to
learn how to develop low level stuff with Rust and new programming concepts which Rust has.
For getting close with Rust community and use cases, I'd like to attend the
[Rustfest 2018 ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·](https://paris.rustfest.eu/) conference.

The conference was 4 days. All the presentations are made in first day. Second day was for workshops. Third and fourth
days were for impl days which are discussion days.

## Impressions
- Rust has great community. The community is very helpful to newcomers. Also, There is a [RustBridge](https://rustbridge.github.io/) for newcomers. I attended this on workshop day. It is rust equivalence of Django Girls Tutorial. Thanks to organizers [@ag_dubs](https://twitter.com/ag_dubs) and [@spacekookie](https://twitter.com/spacekookie), It was a very encouraging workshop.
- A good part of the community members have functional programming background. Besides, They code in several languages in contrast of Python community.
- There were a lot of blockchain people in the conference. They develop applications in Rust.
- Vaidehi Joshi's non-technical talk was very inspirational. I suggest you to watch [it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23lRkdDXqY0).

I became more interested in Rust after the conference. Happy to started this journey.

The talks are available at [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23lRkdDXqY0&list=PL85XCvVPmGQgdqz9kz6qH3SI_hp7Zb4s1).

The next stop of RustFest will be Rome ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹. I look forward for it.

We have been organizing weekly [Python Istanbul](https://www.meetup.com/python-istanbul/) meetups, which have played a key role in building a strong Python community in Istanbul. We have organized 100 meetups without any breaks, along with Django Girls sessions.

As the next step, we are working hard to organize the first [PyCon Turkey](https://tr.pycon.org) with a great team. To promote it within the European Python community, I announced PyCon Turkey 2020 at EuroPython 2019.

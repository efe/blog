Every summer during the intern period at [Hipo](https://hipolabs.com), I mentor new graduates. Each year, I cover topics like the request-response cycle, file handling and the basics of HTTP. This experience inspired me to present a talk at a Python conference. PyConDE accepted my proposal --*It is all about files and HTTP* and I shared my journey in another blog post titled [How I Became a Speaker](/posts/2022-05-29-how-i-became-a-speaker).

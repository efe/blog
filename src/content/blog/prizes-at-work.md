Some companies offer prizes like a bluetooth speakers, mechanical keyboards to employees who complete certain tasks or projects. At first, this might seem like a fun and harmless way to motivate people. But when you look deeper, it raises an important question: **why do employees need extra rewards to do their jobs?**

Employees are already paid a salary to do their work. That should be enough motivation. If companies feel the need to offer prizes, it could point to a deeper problem in the company culture.

- **Lack of Real Motivation** – If employees aren’t excited about their work, the company might try to “buy” their engagement with prizes instead of improving the work environment.
- **Unfair Workload** – Some companies set unrealistic expectations. When employees feel overworked, they might not want to go the extra mile. A prize is then used as a short-term fix to get them to do more.
- **Lack of Recognition** – Employees want to feel valued. If they only receive recognition through prizes, it means the company may not have a culture of appreciation in place.

## A Better Approach

Instead of using prizes as motivation, companies should focus on creating a culture where employees feel valued, engaged, and fairly treated.

- **Recognize Effort Regularly** – A simple “thank you” or public acknowledgment can be more meaningful than a prize.
- **Fair Compensation** – Employees should be paid what they’re worth. Competitive salaries, performance-based raises, and meaningful benefits show that a company values its workforce. Then, anyone can decide what to buy with their money instead of working for a prize. Financial security and freedom allow employees to focus on doing their best work without needing external rewards.
- **A Shared Vision** – When employees truly understand why their work matters, they don’t need external rewards to stay motivated. Companies should foster open communication where employees can voice their concerns, ask questions and engage in meaningful discussions. When people feel heard and involved, they begin to see challenges as their own rather than just the company’s problems. This sense of ownership eliminates the need for prizes because employees are already committed to doing their best work.


Prizes can still have a place at work, but they should be given as surprises to make employees happy rather than as a tool to push productivity. For example, offering two tickets to a concert simply as a gesture of appreciation can strengthen morale without creating a culture of conditional rewards.

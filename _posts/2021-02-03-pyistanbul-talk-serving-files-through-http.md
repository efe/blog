[PyIstanbul](https://pyistanbul.org/) organizes weekly Python events named "Python Saati (Python Hour)". Due to the pandamic, Presentations are online.

I've made a talk for 124th of the Python Saati. The talk was live on [PyIstanbul Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k63NHzL8VEE). It was in Turkish.
